Semaphore Code
	semop
	
		Perform semaphore operations (like up/down)
		
		All operations performed via semop are atomic!
		
		semop( <DESCRIPTOR>, <OPERATION>, <AMOUNT> )
		
			DESCRIPTOR
				You know what this is...
				
			AMOUNT
				The amount of semaphores you want to operate on in the semaphore set.
				
				For a signle semaphore set 1.
				
			OPERATION
			
				A pointer to a struct sembuf value
				
				struct sembuf {
					short sem_op;
					short sem_num;
					short sem_flag;
				};
				
				sem_num
					The index of the semaphore you want to work on.
					
				sem_op
					-1: Down(S)
					1: up(S)
					
						Any -/+ number wil work, you will be requesting/releasing that value from the semaphore
						
					0: Block until the semaphore reaches 0
					
				sem_flag
					Provide further options
					
					SEM_UNDO: Allow the OS to undo the given operation. Useful in the event that a program exits before it could release a semaphore
					
					IPC_NOWAIT: Instead of waiting for the semaphore to be available, return an error.
