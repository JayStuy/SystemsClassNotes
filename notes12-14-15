Aim: Ceci nest pas une pipe

Pipe
	A conduit between 2 seperate processes.
	
	Pipes have 2 ends, a read end and a write end
	
	Pipes are unidirectional (a single pipe must either be read or write only in a process).
	
	Pipes act just like files.
	
	You can transfer any data you like through a pipe using read/write.
	
	Unnamed pipes have no external identification (like a descriptor or name).
	
		pipe - <unistd.h>
	
		Create an unnamed pipe.
	
		Returns 0 if the pipe was created, -1 if not.
	
		Opens both ends of the pipe as files.
	
		pipe( int descriptors[2] )
	
			descriptors	
				Array that will contain the descriptors for each end of the pipe.
			
			
	Named Pipes
		Also known as FIFOs.
		
		Same as unnamed pipes except FIFOs have a name that can be used to identify them via different programs.
		
		Keep in mind that like unnamed pipes, FIFOs are unidirectional.
		
		mkfifo
			Shell command to make a FIFO
			
			$ mkfifo <pipe name>
