SOTD: Shine - Collective Soul

Aim: Are you processes running? - Then you should go out and catch them!

Do Now: Run the command ps in the terminal. What do you see?


Processes
	Every running program is a process. A process can create subprocesses, but these are no different from regular processes
	
	A processor can handle 1 process per cycle (per core). "Multitasking" appears to hppen because the processor switches between all the active processes quickly.
	
	
	pid
		Every process has a unique identifier called the pid
		
		pid 1 is the init process
		
		Each entry in the /proc directory is a current pid
		
		
	getpid() - <unistd.h>
		returns the current process' pid
		
	fork() - <unistd.h>
		Creates a separate process based on the current one, the new process is called the child, the original is the parent.
		
		The child process is a duplicate of the parent process. All parts of the parent process are copied, including stack and heap memory, and the file table.
