C Strings (cstrings)
	Strings are character arrays that end with a null character (either '' or 0 or '\0').
	
	The terminating null character is a convention, stirng functions will not work correctly without it.
	
	The following are valid ways to declare strings:
	
		char s[256];
			Normal array declaration, allocates 256 bytes, nothing is set automatically
			
		char s[256] = "Imagine";
			Allocates 256 bytes, puts "Imagine" in the first 7 bytes AND adds a null at the end of the 8th byte.
			
		char s[] = "Tuesday";
			Allocates 8 bytes, puts "Tuesday" in the 7 bytes AND adds a null at the 8th byte.
