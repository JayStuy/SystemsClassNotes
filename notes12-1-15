SOTD: Say it aint so - Weezer

Aim: You want the signal? You can't handle the signal!

sighandler
	To work with signals in a c program you must create a signal handling function.
	
	Some signals (like SIGKILL) cannot be caught
	
	static void sighandler( int signo )
	
	Must be static, must be void, must take a single int parameter
	
	static
		The function can only be called from within the file it is defined
		
signal
	After you create the function, you attach the signals to it using the signal function:
	
		signal( SIGNUMBER, sighandler )
