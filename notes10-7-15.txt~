Aim: Make it so

Separate compilation

	You can combine multiple c files into a c program by including them all in one gcc command
		ex.
			gcc test.c string.c foo.c woohoo.c
			
	You cannot have duplicate function or global variable names across these files. This includes the main() function
	
	
	gcc -c
		Will compile a c file into a .o file, it is not a fully functional program, but it is compiled code. Do this to compile a .c file that does not contain a main() 			function.
		
	gcc can link .o files together with .c files
	
Make
	Create compiling instructions and setup dependencies
	
	Standard name for the file is makefile
