Shared Memory!

	ftok
	
		Generate a key useful for IPC functions
		
		ftok( path, x )
		
			path
				A path to some file, the file must be accessible by the program running.
				
			x
				An int used to generate the key.
				
			The generated key will be the same if path and x are the same for separate calls.
			
		sd = shmget( ftok("dir/file", 12), 1024, IPC_CREAT | 0664 )
		
	shmdt
	
		Detach a variable from a shared memory segment.
		
		Returns 0 upon success or -1 upon failure.
		
		shmdt( pointer )
		
			pointer
				The address used to access the segment
				
		example
			shmdt( p );
			
	shmctl
		Each share memory segment has metadata that can be stored in a struct (struct shmid_ds)
		
		Some of that data stored: last access, size, pid of creator, pid of last modification
		
		Perform operations on the shared memory segment
		
		shmctil( descriptor, command, buffer )
		
			descriptor
				Return value of shmget
				
			commands:
				IPC_STAT: populate the buffer (struct shmid_ds) with information
				
				IPC_SET: set some of the information for the segment to the info in buffer
				
				IPC_RMID: Remove a shared memory segment
