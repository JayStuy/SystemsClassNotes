SOTD: Us and Them - Pink Floyd

Aim: Go fork off (another process)


	fork() - <unistd.h>
		Creates a seperate process based on the current one, the new process is called the child, the original is the parent.
		
		The child process is a duplicate of the parent process. All parts of the parent process are copied, including stack and heap memory, and the file table.
		
			A quick note on threads: A thread is a seperate executable entity similar to a child process, except a thread is not a standalone process. It does not have its own
			memory space, instead it shares it's parent's memory.
			
		Returns 0 to the child and the child's pid to the parent or -1(errno).
		
		If a parent process ends before the child, the child's new parent pid is 1.
		
		
	wait - <unistd.h>
	
		Stops a parent process from running until any child has provided
