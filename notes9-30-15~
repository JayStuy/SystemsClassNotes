SOTD: One Headlight - Wallflowers

Aim: How to write functioning code

Functions: A brief interlude

	All c functions are "pass by value"
		A parameter is a copy of the variable passed into the function. The original variable is not touched.
		
	function headers
		<return type> <name> (<parameters>)

	You must declare a function before you use it. This can be done in a few ways:
	
		1) Write the entire function at the top of your code, making sure to keep the order correct.
		
		2) Write the function headers at the top of your code, and then provide the full definition later
		
		3) Put all the functions headers in a seperate file (ending in .h). Then include that file in your .c file and provide the definitions there
		
		
Back to Ctrings

	string.h
		C library that includes useful string functions.
		
		All the functions assume that the parameter strings are always null-terminated.
		
		int strlen( char *s )
			Returns the number of characters from the start of s up to but not including the terminating null
			
		int strcmp( char *s1, char *s2 )
			Returns 0 if s1 and s2 are identical up to the terminating null.
			
			Returns a positive number if s1 is greater than s2 (lexicographically)
			
			Returns a negative number if s1 is less than s2
			
		char * strcpy( char *dest, char *source )
			Copies all the chars up to and including the terminating null from source into destination
			
			Returns dest
			
		char * strcat( char *s1, char *s2 )
			Appends all the characters up to and including the terminating null in s2 to the end
			
			Returns s1
