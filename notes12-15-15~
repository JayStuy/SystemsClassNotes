SOTD: Tropicalia - Beck

Aim: A pipe by any other name...

Named Pipes

	mkfifo - <sys/types.h> <sys/stat.h>
	
		c function to create a FIFo
		
		Returns 0 on success and -1 on failure
		
		Once created, the FIFO acts like a regular file, and we can use open, read, write, and close on it.
		
		mkfifo( <name>, <permissions> )
		
		FIFOs will block on open until both ends of the pipe have a connection.
