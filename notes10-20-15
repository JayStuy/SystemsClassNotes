SOTD: Wheels - Cake

Aim: File this under useful information.

Do Now: What are the different kinds of file permissions?

Permissions:
	Who can access- read, write, execute
	
	
There are three permission "areas"
	user, group, others
	
	each area can have its own permissions:
		644 => user: read + write, group: read, other: read
		
		read		write		execute
		1			0			0		=> 4
		0			1			0		=> 2
		0			0			1		=> 1
		
The owner of a file can always change permissions on that file, even if they do not have access to the file.

use chmod to change permissions
chown to change owner
chgrp to change the group
