SOTD: The last 8 songs on Abbey Road - The Beatles

Aim: Sometimes you have to ask your server for another fork

Basic Server
	1) Basic Handshake
	
	2) Server gets data from client, "processes" it and sends back a response.
	
	3) Once the client exists, the server recreates a new WKP, removes the old client connections and the steps restart.
	
	
Forking Server

	Main server forks off dedicated subservers for each client connection.
	
	Allows for multiple simultaneous clients.
	
	Handshake procedure is modified on the server:
		1-6 are the same
		
		7) Server forks off a subserver.
		
		8) *Subserver* connects to client pipe, sending an initial acknowledgment message.
		
		
	After the Handshake:
	
		Main server creates a new WKP and waits for a new client.
		
		
	Central Dispatch Server
		Main server handles all incoming connections.
		
		Subservers are forked off to handle outgoing connections.
