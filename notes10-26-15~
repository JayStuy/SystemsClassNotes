Aim: Seek and ye shall find

umask - <sys/stat.h>

	Set the file certain permission mask
	
	By default, created files are not given the exact permissions provided in the mode argument to open.
	
	A mask is applied that automatically shuts off certain permissions.
	
	Umask is applied by using bitwise negation on the mask, then bitwise anding it to the mode.
		new_permissions = ~mask & mode
		
	The default mask is 022, which shuts off write permissions for group and other.
	
	umask( <MASK> );
		You can define the umask unsing a 3 digit octal #
		umask( 0000 0;
		
	lseek - <unistd.h>
	
		Set the current position in an open file
		
		lseek( <FILE DESCRIPTOR>, <OFFSET>, <WHENCE> );
