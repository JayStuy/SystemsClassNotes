SOTD: For What It's Worth - Buffalo Springfield

Aim: I need information, stat!

Do Now:
	1) Make a directory
	2) Put a few files in that directory and maybe even a directory or two
	
	
	
Stat - <sys/stat.h>

	Get information about a file (metadata)
	
	stat( <PATH>, <STAT BUFFER> )
	
		struct stat sb;
		stat( "foo", &sb );
		
	stat buffer
	
		Must be a pointer to a struct stat
		
		All the file information gets put into the sat buffer.
		
		Some of the fields in struct stat:
			st_size
				file size in bytes
				
			st_uid, st_gid
				user id, group id
				
			st_mode
				file permissions
				
			st_atime, st_mtime
				last access, last modification time
				
				These are struct time_t variables. We can use functions in time.h to make sense of them
				
				ctime( <struct time_t *> )
					returns the time as a string
					
				time( <struct time_t *> )
					sets the parameter to the current time
