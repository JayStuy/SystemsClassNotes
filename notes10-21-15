Aim: Opening up a whole new world of possibilities.

File Table
	A list of all files used by a program while it is running
	
	Contains basic information like the file's location and size
	
	The file table has a limited size, which is a power of 2 and commonly 256. getdtablesize() will return this value
	
	Each file is given an integer index, starting at 0, this is referred to as the file descriptor
	
	
	There are 3 files always open in the table:
		0 or STDIN_FILENO: stdin	--> standard in
		1 or STDOUT_FILENO: stdout	--> standard out
		2 or STDERR_FILENO: stderr	--> standard error
		

open - <fcntl.h>
	Add a file to the file table and returns its file descriptor
	
	If open fails, -1 is returned, extra error information can be found in errno
	
		errno is an int variable that can be found in <errno.h>, using strerror (in string.h) on errno will return a string description of the error
		
		
	open( <PATH>, <FLAGS>, <MODE> )
	
	mode
		Only used when creating a file. Set the new file's permissions using a 3 digit octal #
		
		Octal #s have a leading 0
			0644, 0777 ...
			
	flags
		Determine what you plan to do with the file.
		
		Use the following constants:
			O_RDONLY
			O_WRONLY
			O_RDWR
			O_APPEND
			O_TRUNC
			O_CREAT
			O_EXLCE: when combined with O_CREAT, will return an errorif the file exists

				~a brief interlude~
				
	bitwise operators
		&: bitwise and
		|: bitwise or
		~: bitwise not
		^: bitwise xor
		
		
		logical operators work on each bit of a value
		
		char c = 13;	//00001101
		char x = ~c;	//11110010
		
		
	flags
		Each flag is a number, to combine flags we use bitwise or
		
		O_WRONLY = 1		00000001
		O_APPEND = 8
